Project Outline: Blogging Platform API
1. Project Idea
The goal of this project is to develop a robust, scalable, and fully functional Blogging Platform API using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). This API will serve as the backend for any modern frontend application (React, Vue, mobile app, etc.), providing all necessary functionalities for content creation, management, and retrieval.
2. Key Features
The platform will include two main functional areas: User/Authentication and Content Management.
User & Authentication
? User Registration & Login: Secure system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
? User Roles: Differentiate between standard users (readers) and authors (users who can create posts).
? Profile Management: Users can view their own profiles.
Content Management (Blog Posts)
? Post CRUD: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for blog posts.
? Draft/Publish Status: Posts can be saved as drafts or published.
? Categorization: Posts can be assigned to categories.
? Filtering: Specific endpoints to retrieve posts based on an Author or a Category.
? Search: Ability to search for posts by title or content keywords.
3. Technical Stack and API
? Primary Framework: Django (Python)
? API Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF)
? Database (Local): SQLite (for development)
? Database (Production): PostgreSQL (required for Heroku/PythonAnywhere deployment)
? Authentication: Simple JWT (for token-based authentication)
4. Models, API Endpoints, and Technical Design
A. Database Models (Django ORM)

ModelFieldsRelationshipsNotes
Userusername, email, password, first_name, last_name, is_author (boolean)N/AExtend Django's built-in AbstractUser. is_author determines if they can create/edit posts.Categoryname, slugN/AUsed for filtering and organizing posts. slug for clean URLs.Posttitle, slug, content, status (Draft/Published), created_at, updated_atauthor (ForeignKey to User), category (ForeignKey to Category)The core content model. Permissions are based on the author field.
B. API Endpoints
All endpoints will be prefixed with /api/v1/.

EndpointMethodDescriptionAuthentication Required/auth/register/POSTRegister a new user.No/auth/login/POSTAuthenticate and return JWT token.No/posts/GETList all published
posts.No/posts/POSTCreate a new blog post.Yes (Author)/posts/<slug>/GETRetrieve a single post.No/posts/<slug>/PUT/PATCHUpdate a post.Yes (Author, must
be post owner)/posts/<slug>/DELETEDelete a post.Yes (Author, must be post owner)/posts/category/<ca tegory_slug>/GETList all published posts for a given category.No/posts/author/<user name>/GETList all published posts for a given author.No/categories/GETList all categories.No
5. 5-Week Project Plan
This plan breaks down the project into manageable weekly sprints, with an estimated time allocation for each major task.
?? Week 1: Setup and Core Models (20% Complete)

TaskDetailsProject SetupInitialize Django project, create virtual environment, install basic dependencies (Django, djangorestframework).Database ConfigurationConfigure development database (SQLite).Model CreationDefine User, Category, and Post models in models.py.Admin PanelRegister all models in the Django Admin for easy initial data management.TestingWrite basic model tests to ensure data integrity.?? Week 2: Authentication and Basic API (40% Complete)

TaskDetailsInstall AuthenticationInstall and configure djangorestframework-simplejwt.Auth EndpointsImplement register, login, and refresh token endpoints.User Serializers/ViewsCreate serializers and views for user list (admin only) and user profile retrieval.Permission ClassImplement a custom permission class to check for is_author status.
?? Week 3: Post CRUD Functionality (65% Complete)

TaskDetailsPost SerializerCreate PostSerializer (including nested data for author and category).Post ViewSetImplement the PostViewSet with full CRUD operations.Permission IntegrationApply permissions to ensure: 1) Only authors can create. 2) Only the post owner can update/delete. 3) Only published posts are publicly readable.Slug GenerationImplement automatic slug generation on post creation/title update.?? Week 4: Filtering and Custom Endpoints (85% Complete)

TaskDetailsCategory EndpointsImplement ListAPIView for listing categories.Filtering by CategoryImplement the /posts/category/<slug>/ endpoint using get_queryset filtering.
Filtering by AuthorImplement the /posts/author/<username>/ endpoint.Search FunctionalityIntegrate Django REST Framework's SearchFilter to allow keyword searches on post titles and content.
?? Week 5: Polish, Testing, and Deployment (100% Complete)

TaskDetailsComprehensive TestingWrite unit and integration tests for all major views and permissions.DocumentationGenerate API documentation (e.g., using drf-spectacular for OpenAPI/Swagger documentation).Deployment PrepFinalize requirements.txt, create Procfile for Heroku, configure production settings (environment variables, security keys).DeploymentDeploy the application to the chosen service (Heroku or PythonAnywhere) and confirm all endpoints are functional.
6. Important Planning Notes
Production Database
It is critical to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL (or a similar production-grade database) before deployment. Cloud platforms like Heroku/PythonAnywhere will reset SQLite databases regularly.
Permissions
The core logic of this project relies on custom DRF permissions. I will need to define:
1. IsAuthenticatedAuthor: Allows POST only if the user is logged in and user.is_author is true.
2. IsOwnerOrReadOnly: Allows PUT/PATCH/DELETE only if the user is the post's author, otherwise read-only access.

URL Structure
I will use the slug field in the URL for better SEO and readability (e.g.,
/posts/my-first-blog-post-slug/) rather than using primary keys (IDs).
