1. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Our project is a simple blog platform that allows users to register, log in, create blog posts, and delete or manage their own content. The system also supports comments on blog posts.

The ERD consists of three main entities: User
? user_id (Primary Key)

? username

? email

Comment

? comment_id (Primary Key)

? content

? user_id (Foreign Key ? User)

? post_id (Foreign Key ? Post)

? created_at
